constructor
    Special member function
    create and initialize an object

rules
    it must be public
    its name is same as class name
    no return type

    example:-
    public class bank{
    private int name;
    public bank(){     //its the constructor (its a default constructor)
    }
    }
   it is called automatically when we create an object in the main class ex- bank b =new bank(); here bank() is the constructor function
    if we dont create and constructor java compiler will create an default constructor.
    we can use constructor to initialize value to the data members
    it has no return type but returns the object.
    2 types
    default
    parameterized

    example of parameterized constructor
     public class bank{
        private int name;
        public bank(int name){
        this.name=name;
        }
      }
      here we are using parameterized constructor to initialize the data member 'name' we can use the same in any class
      and for different programs and different number of data members
       we can also do constructor overloading same as function overloading
