 The toString() method in the Laptop class is a method that is overridden from the
Object class in Java. It is used to provide a string representation
of an object. In the context of the Laptop class, it would typically be used to
return a string that represents the state of a Laptop object, including its model and
price.  In the date_ class, the toString() method is implicitly called when the Laptop
object is passed to System.out.println(). The println() method calls the toString()       method on the object to get a string representation of the object, which it then prints
to the console.
